# Smart Phone App

Smart phone applications implemented in java using GUI

It's a bit mess because it started from a simple excercise, and we were asked to add more and more applications and things.

Phone.java is the runnable file, just run it and use it as you wish.
Should be in "project4" package.
timer.png should be in the project folder.
to_be_loaded.txt can be used to load contacts.
